## Project Overview
This project presents an interactive e-commerce data visualization dashboard built using Google Looker Studio. The dashboard analyzes transaction performance to understand sales trends, profitability, and campaign effectiveness throughout 2022. The dataset used in this project is a simulated Tokopedia e-commerce dataset and is intended solely for analytical and educational purposes.

## Key Analysis Focus
- Relationship between Value Sales (Before Discount), Net Profit, and Average Order Value (AOV)
- Monthly transaction trends during 2022
- Product categories and items contributing to revenue and profit
- Impact of discounts, margins, and operational costs on overall profitability
- Analysis of payment methods and transaction validity

## Dashboard Insights
- April recorded the highest Value Sales and Net Profit (approximately Rp700 million), driven by increased transaction volume and effective discount campaigns.
- Entertainment and Computing emerged as the top-performing product categories.
- In August, Value Sales and AOV increased, but Net Profit declined due to high discount rates and products with negative margins.
- A significant performance decline was observed in Q4, influenced by high operational costs (COGS) and loss-making products.
- No valid transactions were identified for the Jazzwallet payment method in the Mobile & Tablets category.

## Tools Used
